# 🐾 Animal Classification using Machine Learning

This project is aimed at building a simple image classification model that can identify different types of animals using their images. It uses supervised machine learning techniques to classify the images, based on extracted features from input data.

## 📊 Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   - (Can be done manually or using a dataset of animal images)

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Resizing, flattening images  
   - Encoding labels  
   - Normalization

3. **Model Training**  
   - Using a classifier like KNN / SVM / Random Forest (depending on notebook)

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy score  
   - Confusion matrix  
   - Visualization using `seaborn`

5. **Prediction**  
   - Taking a sample image (like `dog.jpeg`) and predicting its class
